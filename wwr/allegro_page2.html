                    <h1>Learning music gives a lot of benefits especially to children. Allegro provides opportunity for children to learn about music. The reduced levels of stress, anxiety, and depression found in children who play an instrument is largely due to the emotional expression and relaxation provided through a musical outlet. For instance, if they are dealing with difficult emotions or feeling overwhelmed, they can express themselves and decompress through playing music. The increased self-esteem found in children who play an instrument is from the satisfaction of achievement from accomplishing a goal, such as learning a song, writing a composition, or performing for an audience.</h1>

                    <h1>Limiting electronics is something many parents and even adults need to be doing more and more. The effect of excessive time spent on electronics is linked to increased brain atrophy, impaired cognitive functioning and even increased cravings due to impaired dopamine functioning. Learning to play piano is an activity for kids and adults alike to move away from “screen time” and have an unplugged outlet for entertainment (Psychology Today). Here in allegro we provide piano lessons for all ages.</h1>
