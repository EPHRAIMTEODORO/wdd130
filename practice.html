        <p>Hello everyone, I live in the Philippines and I plan to pursue a degree on computer science. This is a photo We took during our P-day on my mission and the place looked a lot like the grove where Joseph Smith prayed so we all took a "first vision pose" and that is me trying to act like there is a bright light above me. I really like reading novels and playing games that has stories in it. I love dogs. I also like puzzzles which helped me in my previous programming subject because coding felt like solving a puzzle. I chose web design because it will help me have an early start on my career path in programming. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since my childhoos and i have also served my mission.
