        Air-layering, also known as marcotting, is a way of getting clones of woody plants that are often difficult to root from cuttings. This method involves propagating a new plant from a branch still attached to the parent plant, by getting roots to form on the branch. While large number of cuttings can be easily obtained from still green branches or first-year growth, there may be high attrition rate. More time is also needed for these branches to harden and grow to a size suitable for planting out. Air-layering is often the preferred way of propagating fruit trees, rather than growing them from seeds as this may not give plants of the same quality as the parent (true to type). Also, it will take a longer time to grow, as the new plant has to develop from seed through juvenile stage before the first fruits are produced.
