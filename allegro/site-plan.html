      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of my website is to provide knowledge about vegetable gardening, grafting, and marcotting. My website can help people know why some people use grafting and marcotting instead of just using seeds to grow plants.  The website contains information that are easy to understand and instructions that are easy to follow. It will also include images with instruction so that the audience can know what vegetable gardening, marcotting and grafting looks like.

      <h3>VEGETABLE GARDENING</h3>
      <p>Vegetable gardening is a rewarding activity that can provide fresh, flavorful produce. It offers many of the same benefits as other gardening activities, including exercise, fresh air, landscape beautification and enjoyment. In addition, it promotes a varied and nutritious diet at a lower cost by reducing food expenditures more than the costs associated with growing the vegetables. Moreover, many gardeners find that their homegrown produce tastes better than what they can buy at a supermarket, thanks to freshness and more choice of varieties.
        If you love to have fresh produces in the spring and summer, you should consider creating a home vegetable garden. Growing a vegetable garden is a fun and healthy hobby that anyone can excel at. While gardening, you may find that your troubles and stresses of the day simply float away. Home vegetable gardening relieves stress and allows you to be out in the sun. Vegetable gardening is proven to lower blood pressure and clear the mind. Also, the act of nurturing plants and watching them grow is rather soothing. And it can look good too!
        Anyone can create a home vegetable garden. As long as you have dirt somewhere, you can create an outdoor vegetable garden in the solid ground. Even if you donâ€™t have a plot of dirt, you can buy a few pots and create a container garden.

      <h3>MARCOTTING</h3>
      <p>
        Air-layering, also known as marcotting, is a way of getting clones of woody plants that are often difficult to root from cuttings. This method involves propagating a new plant from a branch still attached to the parent plant, by getting roots to form on the branch. While large number of cuttings can be easily obtained from still green branches or first-year growth, there may be high attrition rate. More time is also needed for these branches to harden and grow to a size suitable for planting out. Air-layering is often the preferred way of propagating fruit trees, rather than growing them from seeds as this may not give plants of the same quality as the parent (true to type). Also, it will take a longer time to grow, as the new plant has to develop from seed through juvenile stage before the first fruits are produced.

      <h3>GRAFTING</h3>
      <p>
        Grafting is the act of joining two plants together. The upper part of the graft (the scion) becomes the top of the plant, the lower portion (the understock) becomes the root system or part of the trunk. Although grafting usually refers to joining only two plants, it may be a combination of several. A third plant part added between two others becomes the trunk or a portion of it. This is called an interstem. Multiple grafts may produce an apple tree with several varieties or a rose-of-Sharon shrub with several different colors of flowers.
      </p>
      <p>Some cultivars (varieties) of plants do not come true from seeds. Others are difficult or impossible to reproduce from cuttings or other propagation techniques. Grafting (topworking) is a way to change a large tree from an old to a new variety. It is also a method of using a root system better adapted to soil or climate than that produced naturally by a non-grafted plant. By using special understocks or interstems, grafting is a way to produce dwarf plants.</p>
